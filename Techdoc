# Database Comparison and Confluence Upload Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed to perform the following tasks:

- Retrieve row counts for specified tables in two PostgreSQL databases (db1 and db2).
- Generate comparison reports for db1 and db2.
- Create an XLSX file with a styled header containing the comparison results.
- Upload the XLSX file and two text files (db1_report.txt and db2_report.txt) to Confluence.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (psycopg2, concurrent.futures, requests, datetime, socket, openpyxl)

## Configuration

To use the script, you need to provide the following configuration parameters in the script:

- Database connection details (db1_params and db2_params).
- Confluence URL and authentication details (confluence_url, username, and password).
- Confluence page ID where the files will be uploaded (page_id).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries if not already installed: `pip install psycopg2 concurrent.futures requests openpyxl`
3. Modify the script to provide the required configuration parameters.
4. Run the script: `python script.py`

## Output

After running the script, the following files will be generated:

- `combined_output_<timestamp>_<hostname>.xlsx`: An XLSX file containing the comparison results with a styled header.
- `db1_report_<timestamp>_<hostname>.txt`: A text file with the db1 comparison report.
- `db2_report_<timestamp>_<hostname>.txt`: A text file with the db2 comparison report.

## Logging

The script logs its activities to a log file named `script_<timestamp>_<hostname>.log`.
